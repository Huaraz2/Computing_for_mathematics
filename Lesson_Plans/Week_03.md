# Computing for mathematics: week 3
## Data structures and recurrence

### Aims of this week

At the end of this lecture students will be:

- Understand lists and dictionaries in Python;
- Write and read data to/from files (using the csv module and otherwise);
- Write basic recurrence

### Timeline

#### Lab 1

This lab session will have a basic sheet:

- Understanding lists and certain functions that work on lists;
- Understanding hash tables;
- Using the write, read function;
- Using the csv module;
- A very basic recurrence function.

(All tickable)

#### Lab 2

This lab session will be slightly more advanced:

- Fibonacci using recurrence (tickable)
- Another recurrence exercise
- Create your own Hash table
