Here are various key developments that you might want to attempt to address through this part of the module:

- Identify and respond to othersâ€™ needs, thus building upon their networking and negotiation skills.
- Build trust and develop effective relationships with others both in and outside of the team.
- Work with/connect with external bodies, groups or stakeholders in order to develop their networking, negotiating and relationship building skills.
- Develop awareness of recognising value in ideas.
- Think speculatively, employing both convergent and divergent approaches to arriving at a solution.
- Develop and produce multiple solutions to identified problems through evaluation and analysis.
- Review and evaluate multiple solutions in contexts that anticipate change and contain elements of ambiguity, uncertainty or risk.
- Recognise that generating innovative solutions can sometimes be more meaningful and useful than the final outcome itself.
