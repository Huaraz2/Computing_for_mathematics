The tutor has 4 main roles:

01. The role of the tutor is to give immediate feedback with regards to progress for tickables:

    - Tutors will check your progress and either give you a __tick__ or give a brief indication as to what you need to do to obtain a tick.
    - Ticks are obtained if tutors deem that sufficient effort and comprehension has been carried out. This does not necessarily imply that the student has successfully completed the given question.

02. The tutor will give me (Vince Knight) and Jason Young feedback as to what difficulties students are having. This enables me to better focus the Thursday class meeting.

03. Time permitting, the tutor will possibly give some more help. This role is secondary to the first two and if further help is required tutors are to point you towards:

    - Vince's office hours : 13:00 - 15:00 Thursday;
    - Jason's office hours : 14:00 - 16:00 Wednesday;
    - The wiki;
    - Other resources.

04. Attendance will be taken in tutorials. However if you have completed all your tickables you will not need to attend the second lab session. Your attendance will also be noted if you do not complete any ticks
