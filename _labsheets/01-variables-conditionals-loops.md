General description.

# Installing and running Python

- Anaconda
- Running and executing code
- **T** Notebooks

# Basics

These questions aim to show you the basic building blocks of programming

- **T** Creating numeric variables: basic mathematics on those variables.

  ```python
  >>> age = 20
  >>> age = 20 + 1  # Having a birthday
  >>> age
  21

  ```

- **T** Creating character variables: basic manipulation of strings.
- **T** If statements: boolean variables
- **T** For and while loops: for and while loops

# Further work

These questions aim to push a bit further.

- Use code to check the following identity:

  $$\sum_{i=0}^{n}\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$

  for \(n=200\).

- **T** Modify **the above** to check it for all values less than 1000.

3 other questions that push students a bit.
