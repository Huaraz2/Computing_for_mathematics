General description.

# Basics

These questions aim to show you the basic building blocks of programming

- **T** Writing files
- **T** Reading files
- **T** Recursion: $$n^2$$
- **T** Recursion: fibonacci

# Further work

- csv files
- Recursion function (not fib)
- **T** Read a numbers from file, compute previous function of those numbers and
  write to file
- Sorting algorithm
- Searching algorithm
