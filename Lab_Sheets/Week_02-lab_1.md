# Week 1 - Conditional Statements, flow control and functions

This lab sheet will serve as a basic introduction to programming. After this session you will know the basic python syntax to carry out the following:

- Set up basic variables;
- Write if statements (so called: 'Conditional statements');
- Write while and for loops (so call: 'flow control');
- Define functions;
- Write clear and consistent code.

## Programming in Python

Python is a programming language. There are various other programming languages:

- Java
- C
- C++
- Ruby
- VBA

and many more.

A programming language allows you to write a **program** which is a **sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation**.

When writing a program one makes use of an Integrated Development Environment: **IDE**. There are various (freely available) IDE's:

- Eclipse
- IDLE
- Vim

and many more. We will be using the simplest IDE available: IDLE which comes bundled with python (in your own time be sure to investigate others as it is a question of personal choice).

- **T1**: Open up IDLE and in the **interpreter** type the following code and press `ENTER`:

    print "Hello world"

## Basic variables

Describe what a variable is.

1. Copy this and see what happens.
2. Carry out basic calculation.
3. Going from variable type to an other.

## If statements

Describe basic if statements.

1. Copy this and see what happens.
2. Output something based on length of a variable.
3. Use a raw_input statement.

## Loops

Describe type of if statements in general.

## Functions

Explain functions. Explain how to write functions.

## Writing clear code

Point towards PEP8.
