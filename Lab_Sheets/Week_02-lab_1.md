# Week 1 - Conditional Statements, flow control and functions

This lab sheet will serve as a basic introduction to programming. After this session you will know the basic python syntax to carry out the following:

- Set up basic variables;
- Write if statements (so called: 'Conditional statements');
- Write while and for loops (so call: 'flow control');
- Define functions;
- Write clear and consistent code.

## Basic variables

1. Copy this and see what happens.

1. Copy this and see what happens.
2. Output something based on length of a variable.
