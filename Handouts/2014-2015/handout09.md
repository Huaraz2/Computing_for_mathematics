## What you have learnt this week:

Some basic Sage code to solve differential equations:

    - ODEs;
    - Systems of ODEs;
    - Numerical solutions of ODEs (for when they can't be solved exactly).

## Extracting parts of an equation

Some difficulty on this lab sheet was associated to extracting expressions from solutions of equations.

This basically revolves around the fact that the output of `desolve_system` is a list of equations and not a list of functions.
Plotting equations does not make mathematical sense but plotting a function does (a plot is a graphical representation of a mapping of one set to another).

Take a look at the conversation I had with Henry at the bottom of the Week 9 lab sheet which should explain/direct you to the right spot.

## Numerical analysis

Certain equations and differential equations can't be solved or are very difficult to solve. In this case numerical solutions can still be found. This is what `desolve_rk4` is for.

This is all part of a subject called [Numerical Analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis).

Some applications of this include the solution of equations that describe how many people would be in a queue throughout a day across different hours of the day.

## LaTeX

LaTeX is a language for typesetting (writing) documents.

- Go through the videos on the corresponding [lab sheet]({{site.baseurl}}/LabSheets/Week_10/).
- Take a look at my [coursework template](http://goo.gl/huzjyq).
- There are various other templates available at [https://www.writelatex.com/templates](https://www.writelatex.com/templates).

## What you should do next:

- Work through LaTeX lab sheets.
- **Finish the coursework**
- Contribute to the wiki.
- If anything is still unclear **please** come and see me during office hours.
