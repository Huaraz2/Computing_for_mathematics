Lecturer: Vince Knight

Office: M1.30

**Office hours: Thursday 1300-1500**

## What you have learnt this week:

- You learnt about the mathematical topic of linear algebra;
- You saw how to make relevant calculation in Sage:

    - Determinant
    - Inverse

## Repeating actions over a list

The individual coursework is now available (**due in week 11**): [{{site.baseurl}}/Assessment/IndividualCoursework/]({{site.baseurl}}/Assessment/IndividualCoursework/).

It requires you to use LaTeX (how mathematicians write mathematics). Take a look at the 9th Lab sheet if you want to get started (in the meantime you can get going with the required coding).

## Class test

Here are some summary statistics about the class test marks:

- Total mark:

    - mean 56.23
    - median: 55.00
    - max: 100.00

- q1 mark:

    - mean: 90.09
    - median: 100.00
    - max: 100.00

- q2 mark:

    - mean: 42.79
    - median: 36.67
    - max: 100.00

- q3 mark:

    - mean: 24.81
    - median: 16.67
    - max: 100.00

- Documentation mark:

    - mean: 89.23
    - median: 100.00
    - max: 100.00

Percentage of marks above given mark:

- 0.85 of scripts \\(\geq\\) 40%
- 0.71 of scripts \\(\geq\\) 50%
- 0.38 of scripts \\(\geq\\) 60%
- 0.22 of scripts \\(\geq\\) 70%
- 0.05 of scripts \\(\geq\\) 80%
- 0.01 of scripts \\(\geq\\) 90%

## What you should do next:

- **Start the next sheet**: make sure you spend time working on the sheet **BEFORE** the labs.
- **Start the coursework**
- Contribute to the wiki.
- To make the best use of the lab sessions turn up having finished your sheets;
- If anything is still unclear **please** come and see me during office hours.
