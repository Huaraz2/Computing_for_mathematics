## What you have learnt this week:

- Variables, variables types etc...
- What we can do to numeric variables;
- What we can do to strings;
- If statements;
- Loops (`for` and `while`);

When you save a python script make sure to include the `.py` extension. This ensures that IDLE will be able to open it.
