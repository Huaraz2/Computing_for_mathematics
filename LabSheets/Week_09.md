# Week 9 - Linear Algebra

1. **TICKABLE** Use Sage to solve the following system of equations:

    $$\begin{cases}
    10x+2y=0\\
    2x-y=154
    \end{cases}$$

2. **TICKABLE** Note that the above system of equations is equivalent to the following systems of equations:

    $$\begin{cases}
    10a+2b=0\\
    2a-b=154
    \end{cases}$$

    $$\begin{cases}
    10m+2n=0\\
    2m-n=154
    \end{cases}$$

    In essense the only thing that defines the system of equations is the cofficients:

    $$\begin{pmatrix}
    10,2,0\\
    2,-1,154
    \end{pmatrix}$$


3. Matrix multiplication.
4. Matrix inversion
5. Enter the following matrices in to a list. Invert all of them.
6. Plotting something?
7. Solve a large number of systems of linear equations
8. Reading in data for a big system of linear equations
9. Creating a big linear system.
