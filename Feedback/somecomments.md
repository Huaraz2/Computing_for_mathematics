# Reflections on some feedback

# Negative about methodology

> "I would prefer Thursday's lecture to be aimed at teaching us on the upcoming
> week, rather than a feedback lecture. Although the feedback is good and
> interesting to work out."

> "Hostility"

> "I feel I would really enjoy computing if we were actually taught the basics"

> "Tutors in lab session can't always understand why my codes don't work"

> "More of an importance on non tickables as well as tickables (otherwise why
> are they there?)"

> "Maybe provide some handouts prior to completing lab sheets that explain in
> detail the material for the week - more so than the videos as I struggled to
> find some things online or in books."

> "Some solutions could be explained better."

> "Exponential increase in difficulty"

> "I personally have not done any coding before and I feel that it is often
> assumed that everyone has coded before."

> "Lab test came out of nowhere."

> "Tickables should be put towards grade or have more credit for completing
> them."

# Have not looked at website

> "Giving weblinks for websites which teach you Python so extra resources."

> "Not much revision material for test and therefore feel rather unprepared."

# Not aware of Office hours

> "More support when stuck on questions - eg like a maths support session for
> computing."


# Positive about methodology

> "Labs need to be more noisy"

> "Lectures were very useful but would have been very helpful to receive these
> explanations and examples prior to lab sheet."

> "Extremely easy to contact Vince, very approachable."

> "Vince is very supportive, you can talk to him about the work 90% of the times
> you see him."

> "Maybe add some extra tutorials that are optional or less maths oriented that
> may be considered more fun for people to do without feeling like it is
> work."

> "Working regularly and not leaving everything to the end of the term."

> I hated this subject when I first started but really starting to enjoy it now,
> thanks Vince =).

# Why are we doing this?

> "I don't understand the point in using Python, why do we need it?? That should
> be explained in more detail."

> "Being able to see the handouts/comments of what people struggled with last
> year."

# Quirky or Amusing

> "Do you have snapchat?"

> "The use of lego instead of megablocks"

> "Near Swiss French"

> "I don't like Canadians"

> "Please tell us what your accent is. Suspense is killing me."

# Interesting

> "Lab sheets as pdfs please"
